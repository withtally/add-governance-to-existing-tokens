# Not upgradable token contract example

From the blog post [How to add DAO governance to existing token contracts]()

In this example you can review how to update an existing not upgradable token contract so
 it can be governance compatible and deploy the governance with the new token.
### Pre Requisites

Before running any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an environment
variable. Follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, use this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain artifacts:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Test

Run the Mocha tests:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

To deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy
```

To deploy on Rinkeby:

```sh
$ yarn deploy --network rinkeby
```

## Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can enjoy syntax highlighting for your Solidity code via the [hardhat-vscode](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode) extension.
